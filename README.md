I don't know what this is for

My name is Gage Whatcott and first off, this is very confusing to me but I am excited to learn much more about this to help me with my future career. I was raised in American Fork Utah and now live in Rexburg, ID with my wife where I am attending BYU-Idaho and working where my wife is attending hair school and working as well, so we are super busy!
